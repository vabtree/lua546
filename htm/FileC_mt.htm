<h4><a name="def"></a>Metrics Descriptions</h4>
<p>
<em>File Size, Bytes</em> -- Size of the file, in bytes
<p>
<em>Lines in File</em> -- Number of lines in the file
<p>
<em>Lines of Source Code</em> -- Number of lines of code in the file
<p>
<em>Number of Statements</em> -- Number of statements in the file
<p>
<em>Lines of Comments</em> -- Number of lines of comments in the file
<p>
<em>Comment Ratio</em> -- Ratio of the lines of comments to the lines of source code in the file
<p>
<em>Declarations in File</em> -- Number of top-level declarations in the file, including types, variables, functions and macro defines
<p>
<em>Functions in File</em> -- Number of functions defined in the file
<p>
<em>Variables in File</em> -- Number of variables and parameters in the file.  For local variables and parameters to be counted, data must be collected with the -locals option enabled
<p>
<em>Directly Included Files</em> -- Number of header files in the project database that are directly included by the file
<p>
<em>Trans Included Files</em> -- Number of header files in the project database that are transitively included by the file
<p>
<em>Trans Included Lines</em> -- Number of lines in header files in the project database that are transitively included by the file
<p>
<em>Files Where Dir Incl</em> -- Number of files in the project database that directly include the file
<p>
<em>Files Where Trans Incl</em> -- Number of files in the project database that transitively include the file
<p>
<em>Total Cyclo Complex</em> -- Total cyclomatic complexity for the functions (methods) defined in the file
<p>
<em>Ave Cyclo Complex</em> -- Average cyclomatic complexity for the functions (methods) defined in the file
<p>
<em>Max Cyclo Complex</em> -- Maximum cyclomatic complexity for the functions (methods) defined in the file
<p>
<em>Program Difficulty</em> -- Measure of how compactly the file implements its algorithms (Halstead D).  This is the inverse of the Halstead Program Level (of abstraction)
<p>
<em>Program Volume</em> -- Measure of the information content of the file (Halstead V)
<p>
<em>Intelligent Content</em> -- Language-independent measure of the amount of content (complexity) of the file (Halstead I)
<p>
<em>Mental Effort</em> -- Measure of the number of elemental mental discriminations necessary to create, or understand, the file (Halstead E)
<p>
<em>Maintainability Index</em> -- Measure of the maintainability of the file (Welker MI)
